Project is now deprecated.

Project contained a Discord integrated dashboard connected to a Stripe payment processor.

This web application handled subscriptions to a group that charged payments monthly, authentication handled via Discord OAUTH2.

Discord Bot was a webhook that checked user's payment dates daily, and upon expiration or renewal of subscription would revoke user's access until payment had completed.

Project in collaboration with @BCarlson1512
